# Flask Docker Application

A simple Flask application containerized using Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine
- Python 3.8 or higher (if running locally)

## Project Structure

│

├── app.py # Flask application
├── Dockerfile # Docker configuration
└── README.md # This file


## Getting Started

### Building the Docker Image

bash
docker build -t flask-app .

### Running the Container
bash
docker run -p 5001:5001 flask-app


The application will be available at `http://localhost:5001`

## Development

### Local Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the application:
bash
python app.py

## Docker Commands

### Useful Docker Commands

- List all containers:
	bash
	docker ps -a
- Stop all running containers:
	bash
	docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
- Remove all containers:
	bash
	docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
- List all images:
	bash
	docker images

- Remove all images:
	bash
	docker rmi $(docker images -q)


## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you encounter a "port already in use" error:

1. Find the process using the port:
  bash
  lsof -i :5001
  Kill the process:
  bash
  kill -9 <PID>
  2. Rebuild the Docker image:
  bash
  docker build -t flask-app .
  3. Run the container again:
  bash
  docker run -p 5001:5001 flask-app


2. Stop the process or choose a different port

### Common Issues

1. **Container not starting:**
   - Check logs: `docker logs <container_id>`
   - Verify port mappings
   - Ensure no conflicting containers are running

2. **Application not accessible:**
   - Verify the correct URL (http://localhost:5001)
   - Check if container is running
   - Confirm port mappings

3. **Build failures:**
   - Ensure all required files are present
   - Check Docker daemon is running
   - Verify Dockerfile syntax

## Best Practices

1. **Security:**
   - Don't run as root in container
   - Use specific package versions
   - Keep base images updated

2. **Performance:**
   - Minimize image size
   - Use multi-stage builds
   - Optimize layer caching

3. **Maintenance:**
   - Document all configurations
   - Use meaningful tags for images
   - Regular security updates
